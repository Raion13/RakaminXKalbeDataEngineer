# RakaminXKalbeDataEngineer
Part of Virtual Internship from Rakamin X Kalbe Nutritionals

# Situation

In this project, Kalbe Nutritionals is conducting a Data Engineering Virtual Internship Experience with the collaboration of Rakamin. The main goal is to enhance the skills and knowledge of data engineering through various challenges and tasks.

## Background

Kalbe Nutritionals is a leading nutrition company in Indonesia, focused on providing high-quality nutritional products to improve people's health and well-being. They have a diverse range of products that cater to different age groups and health needs.

## Problem Definition

The challenge is to complete a series of tasks that involve scripting, database operations, and data modeling. The tasks are to test the the ability to work with data in different formats and systems, ensuring they can handle real-world scenarios.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience in data engineering tasks. By completing these challenges, I gain practical knowledge and skills that are relevant to the fields of data engineering and database management.

# Task & Actions

| No | Task | Actions | Reasons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | - Create a shell/bash script to check directory existence.
- Enhance the script to handle additional conditions. | - Use variables to set the path and directory name.
- Include variables for source and target directories, and filename.
- Implement file copying from the source to the target directory.
- Create a log file with "File Moved Successfully" content on success. | - Ensures flexibility in checking different directories.
- Allows for copying files and creating log files for successful operations. |
| 2 | Complete the Python code to insert data into a PostgreSQL database. | - Set up the connection to the PostgreSQL database.
- Use a cursor object to execute SQL queries and insert data into the 'KARYAWAN' table. | - Establishes a connection to the database for data insertion and retrieval.
- Facilitates data insertion into the specified table using SQL commands. |
| 3 | Convert instructions into SQL Query Language. | - Create the 'KALBE' database and define the 'Inventory' table.
- Insert data into the 'Inventory' table and perform SQL operations (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Use SQL to retrieve orders based on specified conditions. | - Sets up the database and table for storing inventory data.
- Allows data to be added, updated, and retrieved from the 'Inventory' table using SQL commands.
- Provides the ability to query and display specific customer orders based on conditions. |
| 4 | Identify and solve a problem in a given picture. | Analyze the provided picture to identify the issue. | Encourages problem-solving skills and the ability to identify and resolve issues. |
| 5 | Design a simple star schema for the KALBE database. | - Define the fact table and five dimension tables.
- Establish relationships between the tables and specify primary and foreign keys. | - Establishes a star schema for organizing and relating data in the database.
- Ensures data integrity and facilitates data retrieval and analysis across related tables. |

# Result

The result of the tasks and actions in this project is to gain practical knowledge and hands-on experience in data engineering tasks. By completing the challenges, I have enhanced my skills in scripting, database operations, and data modeling, which are crucial in the field of data engineering and database management.

1. **Shell/Bash Script**: The created script will be able to check the existence of directories, handle additional conditions, and perform file copying with the flexibility of setting different paths and directory names. It will also create a log file to indicate successful file movement.
2. **Python Code for PostgreSQL**: The completed Python code will enable data insertion into the 'KARYAWAN' table in the PostgreSQL database. It establishes a connection to the database and uses a cursor object to execute SQL queries for data insertion.
3. **SQL Query Language**: The converted instructions will create the 'KALBE' database and define the 'Inventory' table. The SQL operations will allow data insertion, retrieval, and updates in the 'Inventory' table based on specified conditions.
4. **Problem-Solving Skills**: The ability to identify and resolve issues in a given picture demonstrates problem-solving skills, which are valuable in data engineering tasks.
5. **Star Schema Design**: The designed star schema for the KALBE database will consist of a fact table and five dimension tables. It establishes relationships between the tables and specifies primary and foreign keys, ensuring data integrity and facilitating data retrieval and analysis across related tables.

Overall, the completion of these tasks will equip me with valuable skills and knowledge in data engineering and database management, contributing to my professional growth and expertise in this field.
